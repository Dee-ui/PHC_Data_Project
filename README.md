# PHC_Data_Project
This project builds an AI-assisted system for strengthening Primary Health Care (PHC) in Africa. The system will predict facility patient surge and risk of medicine stock-out. It'll also include a assistant that can give advice to patients based on their symptoms and include interactive maps, mobile prototype and a dashboard for decision makers.
